Using R with Poisson Distribution, I analyzed the Finnish Hockey league Liiga data to predict the league champion. The project was conducted in April 2018, before the season ends.

Description of the project can be found in the file **Introductionpart_betting.docx**, and it was conducted as a part of course **Data Science for Business 2** from Aalto University, Finland.

Detailed steps of analysis can befound in the R Notebook file *Report.Rmd*. If you don't need to rerun the code (the MonteCarlo simulation part may take awhile), you can have a look at the code and result in *Report.pdf*, which is knitted from the aforemention R Notebook. A more well written report can be found in the *Sport-06-project.pdf*
